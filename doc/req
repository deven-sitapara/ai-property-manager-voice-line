### Project Idea and High-Level Buleet Points

The project idea focuses on an AI-powered property management voice line designed to automate and streamline maintenance requests from tenants. Instead of a human manually handling calls, a sophisticated AI system can manage the process from start to finish. This not only improves efficiency but also ensures that urgent requests are addressed promptly.

Key features of the AI property manager voice line include:
* **Tenant Calls**: Tenants call a dedicated number to report maintenance issues.
* **Real-Time Transcription**: The AI transcribes the tenantâ€™s spoken words into text in real-time.
* **Issue Classification**: The system classifies the issue as either urgent or non-urgent based on keywords and context.
* **Automated Ticketing**: The AI creates a ticket in the property management system, prioritizing it based on urgency.
* **Vendor Dispatch**: For urgent issues, the system automatically dispatches a request to a vendor with all necessary details.
* **SMS Notifications**: Tenants receive SMS notifications with updates, including the estimated time of arrival and a link to their ticket.
* **Troubleshooting Support**: For non-urgent issues, the AI can send troubleshooting steps via SMS.
